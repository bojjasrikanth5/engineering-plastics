This Privacy Policy applies to www.engineeringplastics.in (hereinafter, “us”, “we”, or “www.engineeringplastics.in”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p><p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p><p>Website Visitors<br>Engineering Plastics collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Engineering Plastics’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Engineering Plastics’ visitors use its website.</p><p>Engineering Plastics also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on its website.

The amount and type of information that Engineering Plastics gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use the enquiry or RFQ forms, to provide their email address.</p><p>Security<br>The security of your Personal Information is important to us and we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information. We do not guarantee its absolute security.</p><p>Advertisements<br>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

Engineering Plastics will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Engineering Plastics discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental requests, or when Engineering Plastics believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Engineering Plastics, third parties or the public at large.</p><p>If you are a user of www.engineeringplastics.in and have supplied your email address, Engineering Plastics may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, address your service request, or keep you up to date with what’s going on with Engineering Plastics and our products.
